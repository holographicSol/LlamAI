A project built around llama on Windows 11 utilizing embedded systems over serial for sensory information. 


The intention is to provide llama with sensory data from embedded systems or other sources, query llama bout that data and
potentially instruct another/same embedded system(s) to perform task(s) predicated upon the output.
